I used AJAX on the search, you can see this by starting to type out a name like 
"lebron", and you will see if come up with players as it becomes clear. I
implemented it using javascript.

My results page doesn't quite look "really really nice", but it does look at least
"nice" in my opinion. I implemented it by using some of the images on the NBA
website for the team, as well as HTML/CSS/JS for the formatting and coloring of
each player's "card" in the results area on the page.
