In order to implement the website search, I made an html page that would have an
input modeled on how google looks but with the NBA logo. The search field would
take in names and then after three characters are typed would send an AJAX request
that would hit a php script with whatever the user has currently typed. This php
script would take a the letters typed into the search box at the time, and connect
to an RDS database and perform a query with wildcards on both sides of the search
parameter in order to bring up any relevant players that the user might search for.
the results of that query are presented as a JSON object which the AJAX request then
parses and creates "cards" for each player, showing their name, team icon, and stats
in a table off to the side.

In order to implement the website, I utilized namecheap as a provider of a name,
and I used Amazon EC2 for hosting the website, and Amazon's RDS for hosting the
database i kept player data in. In order to get my data, i used a csv file given
to me by my instructor on NBA player stats, cleaned it up by writing a script in
python and having that python generate the SQL code in order to create the tables
necessary for the data in the csv file. I then piped the SQL code to my RDS instance
which set up the table and put in all the necessary data.

In order to get all of the team icons, I used the NBA website to see the URLs of
their team icons and used them myself. In order to do this, i had to issue some
update statements to my database as some of the team names that were in my database
weren't the abbreviations that the NBA website was using. This RDS instance was
running MySQL.
